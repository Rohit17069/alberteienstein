<div id="about">
    <p>1. Born: Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire.
<br>        <br><br>

        2. Theory of Relativity: His most famous work includes the development of the theory of relativity, which comprises two major parts: the special theory of relativity (1905) and the general theory of relativity (1915).
        <br><br>


        3. Nobel Prize: In 1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which is a crucial discovery in quantum physics.
        <br><br>


       4. Mass-energy equivalence: Einstein's equation E=mc², from his theory of relativity, demonstrated that mass and energy are interchangeable, leading to groundbreaking advancements in nuclear physics.
       <br>
       <br>

        5. E=mc² and Nuclear Weapons: His work on the theory of relativity laid the foundation for the development of nuclear energy and nuclear weapons.
        <br><br>


        6. Emigration to the United States: Due to rising anti-Semitism in Germany, Einstein emigrated to the United States in 1933, where he became a professor at Princeton University.
        <br>
        <br>

        7. Humanitarian Efforts: Einstein was an advocate for civil rights, pacifism, and disarmament. He campaigned against racism, militarism, and nuclear proliferation.
        <br><br>


        8. Unified Field Theory: Einstein spent much of his later life in pursuit of a unified theory that would unify the fundamental forces of nature. However, he never succeeded in finding one.
        <br><br>


        9. Death: Albert Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, USA, at the age of 76.
        <br>
        <br>

        10. Legacy: Albert Einstein is widely regarded as one of the greatest scientists of all time, and his theories continue to form the basis for much of modern physics. His name has become synonymous with genius and creativity.
